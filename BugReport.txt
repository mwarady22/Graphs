When I run "make check" (or "make PYTHON=python check" since my "python3" is called "python") it finds all files except for testing/make
and testing/trip.  I am passing all the other tests (graph.UnitTest, make.UnitTest, trip.UnitTest, grader.SimpleUnitTest) so it is clearly
able to find files in proj3 other than those in the testing folder.  I have checked with friends and the files in testing under testing/make
and testing/trip are all in the right place.  However, I still get this error:
